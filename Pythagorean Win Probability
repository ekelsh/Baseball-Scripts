#Bill James Pythagorean Algebra
  #W% = W/(W+L) = Runs^2 / (Runs^2 + Runs Allowed^2)
  #W% = W/l = Runs^2/Runs Allowed^2

#Trying to find the best exponent for (R/RA)2   (2 becomes M)

#Log Transformation
  #Log(W/L) = M * Log(R/RA)
  #y = m * x (+ e)
      #y is Log(W/L)
      #m is exponent we're trying to find  (slope)
      #x is Log(R/RA)
      #e is error

#Step 1: Basic Scatter Plot
plot(Sab101$RunsRatio, Sab101$WinRatio, main= "Runs Ration v. Win Ratio")

#Step 2: Add Log Transformation
WinRatioLog = with(Sab101, log(WinRatio))
RunsRatioLog = with(Sab101, log(RunsRatio))

#Step 3: Scatter Log of Log Transformed Variables
plot(WinRatioLog, RunsRatioLog, main= "Log Runs Ration v. Log Win Ratio")

#Step 4: Run Linear Model
LogModel <- lm(WinRatioLog ~ RunsRatioLog)
LogModel
#Coefficient in RunsRatioLog reveals slope of best fit line (1.867)
#This Coefficient Becomes the exponent in our *new* Pythagorean Theorem
